<h1>Mauritanian Traditinal</h1>
<p>Mauritania is a country rich in cultural traditions that reflect its Arab, Berber, and African heritage.<br>
     One of the most important aspects of Mauritanian tradition is hospitality — visitors are warmly welcomed and offered tea, usually served in three rounds, each with a different level of sweetness.<br>
      This tea ceremony is not just a drink but a symbol of friendship and respect.
       Traditional clothing also plays a big role in daily life; men often wear the daraa (a long blue or white robe), while women wear the colorful melhafa,
        a long piece of fabric wrapped around the body and head.

<p>Music and poetry are deeply rooted in Mauritanian culture, often used to tell stories, celebrate events, or express emotions.<br>
     The griot (traditional storyteller and musician) holds a special place in society, preserving the country’s oral history through songs and poems.<br>
      Traditional Mauritanian music uses instruments like the tidinit (a type of lute) and ardine (a harp played by women).
       Despite modernization, many Mauritanians still honor their nomadic roots, maintaining values of community, simplicity, and respect for nature.
