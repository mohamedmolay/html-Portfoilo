    <h1>About Mauritaniane tea</h1>
    <p>First, the tea is rinsed with hot water.<br> It is then placed in a teapot with a carefully measured amount of water and boiled for a while.<br>
         Next, the person preparing it,  the “tea maker,” pours and repours the drink into multiple glasses, creating foam in each one.<br>
          The drink is then reheated, sweetened, and flavoured with mint before being served hot in small glasses that retain the essential foam,
         which some people prefer not to drink.
        </p>

        <p>In nearly all Mauritanian homes, from the affluent neighborhoods of Tevragh-Zeina, the jewel of Nouakchott, to the most remote corners of peri-urban areas, this beverage is served three to four times a day.<br>
             In fact, this is the minimum frequency as, sometimes, tea flows continuously from morning until bedtime.
